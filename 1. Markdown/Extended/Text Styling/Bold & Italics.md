In order to combine bold and italics you can just wrap your text in three `*` or `_` and it will be both bold and italicized.

***This is both***

___This is also both___

Generally, it is recommended to use `*` instead of `_` since sometimes Markdown does not work well if you have `_` in the middle of a word.
