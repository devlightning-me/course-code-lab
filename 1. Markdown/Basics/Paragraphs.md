## Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Markdown are the default text. If will type a simple text, automatically will be converted to a paragraph. The only important thing is that is necessary to add a blank line between each set of text to separate text into two seperate paragraphs.

`This is a paragraph.`

```
This is a

paragraph.

```
```
This is a paragraph.
  
Since there is a new line between these two sentences they will be converted to two separate paragraphs.

This paragraph
has new lines in it
but
it will not show up as a new line in the output.

This paragraph
has two spaces HERE  
so it will push this onto a new line within the same paragraph.
